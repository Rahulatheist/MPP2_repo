Mark Retail is a hypothetical international retail company that is moving to a new microservices-based architecture for their inventory management website.
The inventory management website helps in managing its Texas warehouse products.
With this software, a warehouse administrator can add the products and their details coming into the warehouse. The software can also maintain the current outstanding demand for the product and keep various administrators' details.
The administrators can also have the provision to upload product worksheets in JSON format.
